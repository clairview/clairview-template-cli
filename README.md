# Clairview Template CLI

A CLI tool to make applying or extracting Clairview "templates" a little easier...well a lot easier.

**Notes:**

- This is a pre-release. It is recommended for use on POC, demo, or greenfield projects only.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Known issues with using MySQL currently, please use ONLY PostgreSQL or SQLite for your database provider.
- Templates are applied / extracted on an all or nothing basis ‚Äì¬†meaning that all the schema, content, and system settings are extracted or applied. We'd love to support more granular operations in the future. (PRs welcome üôè)
- If you are extracting or applying from a remote source, the script can take quite a while depending on the "size" of your instance (how many collections, how many items in each collection, number and size of assets, etc). The script applies a strict rate limit of 10 requests per second using bottleneck.

## Usage

Using the @latest tag ensures you're receiving the latest version of the packaged templates with the CLI. You can review [the specific versions on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clairview-template-cli) and use @{version} syntax to apply the templates included with that version.

### Applying a Template

1. Create a Clairview instance on [Clairview Cloud](https://clairview.cloud) or using self-hosted version.
2. Login and create a Static Access Token for the admin user.
3. Copy the static token and your Clairview URL.
4. Run the following command on the terminal and follow the prompts.

```
$ npx clairview-template-cli@latest apply
```

You can choose from our templates bundled with the CLI or you can also choose a template from a local directory.

### Extracting a Template

The CLI can also extract a template from a Clairview instance so that it can be applied to other instances.

1. Make sure you remove any sensitive data from the Clairview instance you don't want to include in the template.
2. Login and create a Static Access Token for the admin user.
3. Copy the static token and your Clairview URL.
4. Run the following command on the terminal and follow the prompts.

```
$ npx clairview-template-cli@latest extract
```
